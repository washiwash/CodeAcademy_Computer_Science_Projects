#Project Description
"""
Receipts for Lovely Loveseats :
We’ve decided to pursue the dream of small-business ownership and open up a furniture store called Lovely Loveseats for Neat Suites on Fleet Street. With our newfound knowledge of Python programming, 
we’re going to build a system to help speed up the process of creating receipts for your customers.
In this project, we will be storing the names and prices of a furniture store’s catalog in variables. 
You will then process the total price and item list of customers, printing them to the output terminal.
